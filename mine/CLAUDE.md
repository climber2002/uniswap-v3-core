# Uniswap V3 Learning Implementation

This folder contains a step-by-step implementation of Uniswap V3 features using Foundry, built from scratch to understand the protocol mechanics.

## Overview

This is a personal learning project to deeply understand Uniswap V3 by implementing its core features from scratch. The parent folder contains the original Uniswap V3 contracts which serve as a reference, but this implementation is built step-by-step using Foundry to ensure complete understanding of each component.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Add Position (Liquidity Provision)
- [ ] Swap Functionality

## Tech Stack

- Foundry (forge, anvil, cast)
